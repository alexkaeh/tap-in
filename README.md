A web app for beer lovers to find, save, and review beers and breweries.

Provides a publicly viewable list of beers and breweries that can be created and updated by registered "brewmaster" users. Regular users can then view, favorite, and leave reviews on individual beers, while brewmasters are given a portal to edit their brewery's info and add, edit, or remove beers from their brewery's list.

As the third and final bootcamp project, our technical goal was to create a full stack web app using a React front end and a Spring-powered back end with a PostgreSQL database. A standard RESTful API is used to connect the front end to the back end.

This application was left in an incomplete state as of October 1, 2022. Updates to follow, and if you'd like to contribute feel free! Changes will be under an open-source license once I get that all set up :)
